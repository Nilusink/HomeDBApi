# Home Database API
Made with FastAPI, this project aims to make the General-purpose database I host on my RPI a little
more accessible. Although the only implemented features now are weather related, more endpoints for
other different topics will be added.


# Documentation
Since the API was made with FastAPI, the documentation is auto-generated. It can be found here:
